- **Service**: Resend API (3,000 free emails/month)

### 2. **Two Email Templates**

#### Customer Email (Sender)

- Booking details (Bag ID, Tracking Number, Courier)
- **Drop-off instructions** with pickup location
- Delivery location and recipient details
- Parcel information
- Track parcel button

- Non-blocking (booking succeeds even if emails fail)
- Detailed console logging

## 📧 When Emails Are Sent

Emails are sent **automatically** after:
1. ✅ Dropper API booking succeeds
2. ✅ Journey data is saved to database
3. 📧 **Then** emails are sent to both customer and recipient

**If email fails**: Booking still succeeds (emails are optional, not critical)
