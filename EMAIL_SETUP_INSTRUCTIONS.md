---

## üöÄ Quick Setup with Resend (Recommended)

### Step 1: Create Resend Account
1. Go to [https://resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. **Free Tier**: 3,000 emails/month (perfect for getting started!)

### Step 2: Get Your API Key
1. After signing in, go to **API Keys** in the dashboard
2. Click **Create API Key**
3. Name it something like "Sparcel Production"
4. Copy the API key (starts with `re_...`)

### Step 3: Verify Your Domain (Optional but Recommended)

**Option A: Use Your Own Domain (Best for production)**
1. Go to **Domains** in Resend dashboard
2. Click **Add Domain**
3. Enter your domain (e.g., `sparcel.co.za`)
4. Add the DNS records shown to your domain registrar
5. Wait for verification (usually 5-10 minutes)
6. Update email addresses in `src/lib/emailService.ts`:
   ```typescript
   from: 'Sparcel <bookings@sparcel.co.za>'
   from: 'Sparcel <notifications@sparcel.co.za>'
   ```

**Option B: Use Resend's Sandbox (For testing)**
- You can send emails immediately without domain verification
- Emails will come from `onboarding@resend.dev`
- Update email addresses in `src/lib/emailService.ts`:
   ```typescript
   from: 'Sparcel <onboarding@resend.dev>'
   ```

### Step 4: Add API Key to Your Project

1. Open your `.env.local` file (or create it if it doesn't exist)
2. Add your Resend API key:
   ```bash
   VITE_RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Your complete `.env.local` should look like:**
   ```bash
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
   VITE_RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_api_key_here
   ```

### Step 5: Restart Your Dev Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

## üîß Testing

### Test Locally:

1. **With API Key Configured:**
   - Fill out the parcel booking form
   - Submit with valid customer and recipient emails
   - Check your email inboxes for confirmation emails
   - Check browser console for email sending logs

2. **Without API Key (Development):**
   - Emails won't be sent
   - App still works normally
   - Console will show: `‚ö†Ô∏è Resend API key not configured. Skipping email sending.`
   - Console will log: `üìß Email would have been sent to: [emails]`

---

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Emails Not Being Sent?

1. **Check API Key is Set:**
   ```bash
   # In your terminal
   echo $VITE_RESEND_API_KEY
   ```
   Should show your API key

2. **Check Environment Variables Loaded:**
   - Restart your dev server after adding `.env.local`
   - Environment variables only load on server start

3. **Check Resend Dashboard:**
   - Go to **Logs** in Resend dashboard
   - See if API requests are being received
   - Check for any error messages

4. **Check Browser Console:**
   - Look for email sending logs
   - Check for any error messages

5. **Check Email Addresses:**
   - Make sure customer and recipient emails are valid
   - Check spam folder for received emails

### Domain Verification Issues?

1. **DNS Records Not Propagating:**
   - DNS changes can take up to 24-48 hours
   - Use [DNSChecker.org](https://dnschecker.org) to verify propagation

2. **Use Sandbox Mode:**
   - While waiting for domain verification, use `onboarding@resend.dev`
   - Works immediately, no verification needed
